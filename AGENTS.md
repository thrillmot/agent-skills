# AGENTS.md

This is the canonical instruction file for AI coding agents working in this
repository. Tools that understand `AGENTS.md` (Cursor, Codex, Windsurf,
Claude Code, Cline, Continue, Aider, ...) read this file directly. Per-tool
files like `CLAUDE.md` or `.cursorrules` are stubs that point here so the
guidance lives in one place.

## Decision logging — `logmind log` is the commit primitive

This project uses [logmind](https://logmind.dev). **`logmind log` replaces `git add` + `git commit` + `git push` for any change that carries a decision** — do not run those git commands directly.

```bash
logmind log "summary" -r "why" -a "alternative" -i "implication"
```

What counts as a decision, branch routing, `--stage scoped` for unrelated WIP, `logmind doctor`, and the required-reading list ([`docs/timeline.md`](docs/timeline.md), [`docs/decisions.md`](docs/decisions.md), [`docs/file-structure.md`](docs/file-structure.md), `docs/decisions-branches/<branch>.md`) all live in the **`logmind` agent skill** at https://github.com/thrillmade/agent-skills/tree/main/skills/logmind.

## clud-bug — Claude PR review

This repo uses [clud-bug](https://cludbug.dev) for automatic PR reviews.
Full collaboration rules — fix-push flow, skill structure, comment format,
strict-mode mechanics, workflow-edit constraint — live in the bundled
[`clud-bug-collaboration` skill](skills/clud-bug-collaboration/SKILL.md).
Read that skill before pushing fixes addressing prior review threads.

Strict mode is **on** in this repo (workflow check fails on critical findings). Toggle via `.claude/skills/.clud-bug.json`
(read from PR **base ref**, so PRs can't disable strict-mode on themselves).

For agent invocations of the `clud-bug` CLI, prefer `CLUD_BUG_QUIET=1`
(or pass `--quiet`) — suppresses progress chatter and emits a single
`ok <key-value>` summary line per command.

_Installed at clud-bug v0.6.22._
