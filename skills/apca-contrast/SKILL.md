description: Use when picking text-on-surface contrast, auditing an accessibility budget, or generating a color against a specific contrast target. Names the APCA Lc target table (Lc 90 fluent body, 75 body minimum, 60 secondary, 45 large, 30 spot, 15 non-text), the APCACH inverse-composition rule, and the cross-check policy with WCAG 2.2 AA. Cite when an agent reaches for WCAG 2.x as the primary contrast model — APCA is the perceptual model UDTS composes against; WCAG is the cross-check.

# APCA contrast

APCA (Accessible Perceptual Contrast Algorithm) is UDTS's primary contrast model. It reports contrast as **Lc** (lightness contrast) on a 0–105+ scale and is perceptually uniform across light and dark modes — unlike WCAG 2.x's luminance-ratio model, which over-reports contrast for dark colors and under-reports for light ones.

## When to use

- Picking a foreground color for a known background at a specific readability target.
- Auditing a token catalog's contrast budget.
- Generating a palette ladder where each stop targets a specific Lc band.
- Code review: flag any contrast pick that uses WCAG 2.x as the primary model instead of as a cross-check.

## When NOT to use

- Free-class tokens (illustration, decorative, brand-spot) that have no pairing obligation. APCA doesn't apply.
- Single-shot demos or one-off prototypes outside a token catalog where the result won't ship.

## Lc target table

| Lc | Role | Typical use |
|---|---|---|
| **90** | Fluent body | Body text intended for long-form reading. Preferred for paragraphs. |
| **75** | Body minimum | Smallest readable text — ≥ 24 px / 300 wt or ≥ 18 px / 400 wt. |
| **60** | Secondary content | Callouts, secondary headings, button labels at standard weights. |
| **45** | Large display | Display headings (32 px+). Quick scanning, not fluent reading. |
| **30** | Spot-readable | Placeholders, helper text, captions on dim surfaces. Absolute minimum. |
| **15** | Non-text UI | Dividers, focus rings, borders. Threshold for discernible non-text controls. |

Source: APCA spec at [git.apcacontrast.com](https://git.apcacontrast.com/documentation/README). The table maps directly to UDTS's default 11-stop palette ladder (see [foundations/color.md in token.design / UDTS docs](https://token.design)).

## Use APCACH inverse composition — don't pick a color and test

The default failure mode is **pick L and C, convert to hex, run APCA, eyeball Lc, adjust**. Don't.

UDTS uses the [APCACH](https://github.com/antiflasher/apcach) library, which inverts the APCA problem: declare the target Lc, hue, chroma cap, and background; the library binary-searches for the OKLCH lightness that hits the target. The output is guaranteed to satisfy the contrast obligation within ± 1 Lc — no test-and-adjust loop.

```
INPUT  target_lc=75, hue=220, chroma_cap=auto, bg=oklch(0.99 0 0)
OUTPUT oklch(L, c_max, 220) — hits Lc 75 against the near-white surface
```

## WCAG 2.2 AA cross-check (not primary)

After APCACH composition, also verify WCAG 2.2 AA:

- **4.5:1** for normal text (< 18 px or < 14 px bold)
- **3:1** for large text (≥ 18 px or ≥ 14 px bold) and non-text UI

UDTS will not emit a contrast-bound token whose Lc satisfies APCA but whose WCAG ratio fails its declared role. Both must pass.

**Why both:** APCA is the better perceptual model but is exploratory at W3C (removed from the WCAG 3.0 Working Draft in 2023). WCAG 2.2 is the operative legal standard until WCAG 3 ships (≥ 2029). Requiring both means UDTS-generated systems pass current audits *and* are forward-compatible.

## Verification

After composing a contrast-bound color:

1. **APCA check:** `apca_contrast(fg, bg) ≈ declared_lc_target` within ± 1 Lc.
2. **WCAG check:** `wcag_ratio(fg, bg) ≥ declared_role_threshold` (4.5:1 or 3:1).
3. **Direction check:** UDTS Lc is unsigned and direction-aware; ensure the polarity matches the declared role (light text on dark surface vs dark text on light surface use the same Lc magnitude).

If APCA passes but WCAG fails (or vice versa), reject the value and recompose.

## Cross-references

- **REQUIRED BACKGROUND:** `oklch-color-space` for the underlying perceptual model and the APCACH library context.
- **For multi-hue palette generation:** `chroma-harmonization` (the chroma cap at each Lc target is the cross-hue minimum).
- **For the WCAG side:** `wcag-contrast` for the cross-check thresholds and large-text rules.
