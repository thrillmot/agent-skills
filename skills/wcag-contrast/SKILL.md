description: Use when verifying a color pair meets WCAG 2.2 AA contrast requirements as a cross-check on APCA-driven generation, or when auditing a token catalog or design for legal-baseline accessibility compliance. Names the 4.5:1 normal-text rule, the 3:1 large-text rule, the size threshold for "large" stated in points (≥ 18 pt regular ≈ 24 CSS px, OR ≥ 14 pt bold ≈ 18.67 CSS px — not pixels), the SC 1.4.11 non-text rule, SC 2.4.13 focus appearance (AA in 2.2), and the role this check plays alongside APCA. Cite when an agent treats WCAG as the *primary* contrast model, or writes the large-text threshold as "14 px bold / 18 px regular" — UDTS uses WCAG as a cross-check with APCA as primary, and WCAG sizes are in points.

# WCAG 2.2 AA contrast

WCAG 2.2 Level AA is the **legal-baseline** contrast standard for most jurisdictions until WCAG 3 ships (≥ 2029). UDTS uses it as a cross-check alongside its primary model, APCA. Every UDTS-emitted contrast-bound token passes both.

## When to use

- Verifying a foreground / background pair after APCA composition.
- Auditing an existing token catalog or design for legal-baseline compliance.
- Code review on PRs that change color tokens, hover states, or focus indicators.

## When NOT to use

- As the *primary* contrast model when generating new colors. APCACH inverse composition against an APCA Lc target is the generator; this is the cross-check.
- For free-class tokens (illustration, decorative, brand-spot) — they carry no pairing obligation. See `apca-contrast` for the class system.

## The rules

| SC | Level | Rule | Threshold | Applies to |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1.4.3 | AA | Normal text | **4.5:1** | Text < 18 pt (24 CSS px) regular OR < 14 pt (~18.67 CSS px) bold |
| 1.4.3 | AA | Large text | **3:1** | Text ≥ 18 pt (24 CSS px) regular OR ≥ 14 pt (~18.67 CSS px) bold |
| 1.4.11 | AA | Non-text contrast | **3:1** | UI components, focus indicators, graphical objects |
| 2.4.13 | **AA** (added in 2.2) | Focus appearance | Specific minimums | Verify the focus indicator is ≥ 2 px and meets 3:1 contrast against the focused control and adjacent background |
| 2.4.12 | AAA (added in 2.2) | Focus not obscured (enhanced) | n/a | Focus indicator must not be obscured by author content |

**WCAG sizes are in points, not pixels** — a frequent miss. 1 pt = 1.333 CSS px, so:

- 18 pt regular = **24 CSS px** (not 18 px)
- 14 pt bold = **~18.67 CSS px** (not 14 px)

Text at 16 CSS px is *not* "large" even when bold; it falls under the 4.5:1 normal-text rule.

## Computing the ratio

```
L = 0.2126·R_lin + 0.7152·G_lin + 0.0722·B_lin   (sRGB-linearized)
ratio = (L_lighter + 0.05) / (L_darker + 0.05)
```

Always linearize the RGB channels before computing luminance (apply the sRGB gamma reversal: `c <= 0.04045 ? c/12.92 : ((c + 0.055)/1.055)^2.4`). Skipping linearization gives wrong answers — usually undercounting contrast for mid-tones.

For OKLCH-source colors, gamut-map to sRGB first (clamp out-of-gamut chroma at the (L, H) boundary), then apply the formula.

## When WCAG and APCA disagree

WCAG's relative-luminance model over-reports contrast for dark colors and under-reports for very light ones, so APCA and WCAG diverge at the extremes (very dark + very dark, very light + very light, very saturated mid-tones). UDTS finds the safe middle: a token passes only if **both** models pass.

In practice:

- **WCAG passes, APCA fails:** the pairing meets the legal threshold but is *perceptually* hard to read. Reject. (Most common in the dark-on-dark range.)
- **APCA passes, WCAG fails:** the pairing reads fine perceptually but doesn't meet the legal baseline. Reject. (Most common in the very-light range.)
- **Both pass:** ship.

## Verification

For each contrast-bound pairing:

1. Compute the WCAG ratio with sRGB-linearized luminance.
2. Apply the role-appropriate threshold (4.5:1 normal text, 3:1 large text or non-text).
3. Confirm the bold-text size rule in **points** — 14 pt bold (~18.67 CSS px) counts as large; 14 CSS px bold does not. Same for 18 pt regular (= 24 CSS px), not 18 CSS px.
4. Cross-check the APCA Lc (see `apca-contrast`).
5. Reject if either model fails.

## Cross-references

- **REQUIRED BACKGROUND:** `apca-contrast` — the primary contrast model. WCAG is the cross-check; APCA is the generator target.
- **For the underlying color space:** `oklch-color-space` — OKLCH source values must be gamut-mapped to sRGB before applying the WCAG formula.
